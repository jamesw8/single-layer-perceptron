# Single Layer Perceptron Network
Implementing single layer perceptron using the Perceptron Learning Rule
* _Perceptron.py_ contains the Perceptron module
* _train.py_ imports the Perceptron module and trains it to recognize a few Chinese characters represented by 64 bit lists

The rest of the files do the same task but use scikit-learn's single layer perceptron and multi layer perceptron modules.
